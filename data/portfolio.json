What if we could build a platform to let developers write apps to a single standard that would make them compatible with television platforms around the world? The NDS Service Delivery Platform offers APIs to get schedule information, see what’s playing, act as a remote control, schedule recordings and play back recorded content.</p>\n<p>I was responsible for developing an ecosystem of client apps to demonstrate the potential of the platform. I worked with marketing to engage with both television providers and app developers to sell the dream and turn it into reality.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp1.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp2.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/sdp/sdp3.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"home\"></a>\n<h2>Home</h2>\n<p>The film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_%282009_film%29\">Home</a> by Yann Arthus-Bertrand features stunning aerial photography from around the world. This second screen app for iPad shows satellite maps of the locations featured in the movie, zooming from one location to another as scenes change. The location menu lets you jump between scenes, for a non-linear viewing experience that transforms the way in which you consume content.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/home/home.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/home/title.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/home/home.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/home/tn1.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/home/home.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/home/tn2.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"social-zapper\"></a>\n<h2>Social Zapper</h2>\n<p>If all your friends like a TV show, you probably will enjoy it too. Combining the power of the SDP and Facebook APIs, Social Zapper reinvents the traditional schedule grid by showing which of your friends like each show that’s on right now, even allowing you to reorder the channels based on the popularity. It can also recommend shows that you might want to binge based on the overall popularity in your social network. This prototype was later incorporated as a feature of Bento, our cloud-based STB interface.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/social-zapper/social-zapper.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/social-zapper/tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/social-zapper/bento.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/social-zapper/bento-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"topgear\"></a>\n<h2>Top Gear</h2>\n<p>This app demonstrated the potential of SDP for rich syncrhonization of time-based metadata between a set-top box and an iPad second screen. As you watched the “star in a reasonably-priced car” segment in an episode of Top Gear on your TV, you could use your iPad to follow their progress around the race track. Playback state was syncrhonized in both directions, so you could hit fast forward on your remote control or in the app to make the car go faster… or even drag the red dot along the track to scrub back and forth on the TV. The seamless link between the screens was magical.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/topgear/topgear.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/topgear/tn1.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/topgear/topgear.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/topgear/tn2.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/topgear/topgear.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/topgear/tn3.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"surfaces\"></a>\n<h2>Surfaces</h2>\n<p>Imagine if video screens could be as large as you wanted, the size of an entire wall or table? Surfaces was a project that explored the possibilities of creating scalable displays, pushing the relevant content to a number of tiled screens. I created clients that would allow widgets to span adjacent iPads. You could literally drag a widget from one iPad to another, even if one was running a browser and the other a native client written in Swift.</p>\n<a name=\"flare\"></a>\n<h2>Flare</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/flare\">Flare</a> is a concept ecosystem that combines indoor location technologies, wearable devices and an object-oriented data model to help people explore interior spaces and interact with objects in their environment. I implemented the backend in Node, the API layer, and frameworks and demo applications for web, Mac, iOS, Apple Watch, Android, Android Watch and Python. I released an SDK and developer documentation on Ciso’s DevNet developer portal, and hosted hackathons in which external developers used the SDK to develop projects. I presented the platform at the National Retail Federation trade show in New York, giving demos to the engineering leadership of a hundred major retail companies.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral1.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral1-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral2.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral2-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral3.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral3-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral4.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral4-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"twitter-tv\"></a>\n<h2>Twitter TV</h2>\n<p>I did a hacakthon project in which I replaced the entire SDP context and control architecture with one based on the Twitter platform. Your set-top box had its own account and would tweet what you were watching, along with the title card and a description of the episode. Then you could DM your STB with messages like “watch @topgear”, and it would find that show in the grid and change channels for you. Got it up and running in four hours.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/twitter/twitter.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/twitter/twitter-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/twitter/topgear.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/twitter/topgear-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"highlights\"></a>\n<h2>Social Highlights</h2>\n<p>When watching an Apple keynote, there are parts that are more exciting than others. I tried making a highlight reel of the iPad 3 launch, which took hours of my time. What if we could do this automatically by measuring the volume of tweets on a particular hashtag like #ipad during an event? I wrote an algorithm to do exactly that, and made an auto-generated highlight reel. The money shot? When they announced the pricing. Turns out the reel based on hashtag buzz was pretty much the same as the manually curated one. Proved a point in about half a day of work.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad1.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad1-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad2.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad2-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"privacy\"></a>\n<h2>Privacy</h2>\n<p>I gave a presentation on <a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\">privacy</a> considerations in the context of building a personalized television platform. In a world where many people want to share everything about what they’re doing, would we consider your television viewing history to be sensitive personally identifiable information? Everyone knows that the Queen watches television, but can you imagine if the shows she watched turned up in the tabloids? The talk covered the important points of what privacy is, why it’s important, how to protect it, and specific learnings applicable to our current projects.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/privacy/house-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/privacy/google-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/privacy/queen-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/privacy/pins-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"connections\"></a>\n<h2>Connections</h2>\n<p>I designed a <a href=\"portfolio/objects/objects.jpg\">poster</a> for the 2013 NDS developer conference in Bangkok on the theme of “the power of an object oriented system lies not in the objects themselves, but in the connections between them.”</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/objects/objects.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/objects/tn1.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/objects/objects.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/objects/tn2.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"compass\"></a>\n<h1>Compass</h1>\n<p>Compass is the #1 real estate brokerage in the United States, and also a tech company that creates software to make its real estate agents successful.

My team and I worked with marketing to essentially distill the brain of a designer into an app called <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\">Marketing Center</a>, so agents could make high-quality materials using a self-service tool. It gave them enough flexibility to differentiate themselves while at the same time keeping everything on-brand.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/mc1.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/compass/screenshot.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/screenshot-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/mc2.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"window-displays\"></a>\n<h2>Window Displays</h2>\n<p>Marketing Center lets Compass agents create a variety of kinds of print marketing materials, including the listing cards that are displayed in office windows. I worked with the marketing team to create these layouts and implemented them as templates in Marketing Center. So when you walk by a Compass office and see listings in the window, I made that happen.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/compass/window.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/window-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"lefeuil\"></a>\n<h2>Farm Brochure</h2>\n<p>When you’re developing software, you tend to run a program over and over in test mode. But the experience is totally different when you’re using it for real. One day I used Marketing Center to make a brochure for my own farmhouse in the south of France, and had it professionally printed. I put a lot of love into that brochure, which gave me an entirely new perspective on the software product that my team had created. </p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure1.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure1-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure2.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure2-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure3.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure3-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure4.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure4-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"marketing-automation\"></a>\n<h2>Marketing Automation</h2>\n<p>The Compass Marketing Center app made it easy for agents to make any kind of marketing materials, assuming they knew what they wanted to make. But it was still a challenge to remember what materials for what listings they needed to make when, and to decide which collateral types and templates would be most effective. I led the Marketing Automation team in building a system to coordinate an agent’s overall marketing strategy, using AI to give every agent the experience of having a dedicated marketing coach.</p>\n<a name=\"a3g\"></a>\n<h2>Agent at a Glance</h2>\n<p>As Compass scaled organically, agent information was spread across twenty different systems. The first team that I managed built a user adminstration tool called Agent at a Glance (A3G), which let our agent support team get the full picture without having to sign in to multiple systems. We took full advantage of a microservices-based architecture, with each service storing or retrieving a single type of data. </p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/a3g/a3g.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/a3g/a3g-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/a3g/dashboards.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/a3g/dash1.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"fuzzy-names\"></a>\n<h2>Fuzzy Name Matching</h2>\n<p>Identifying the same people in different databases can be a tricky problem. In an ideal world, people would all have a unique identifier that we could use to join records across databases. However, when this is not available, it may be necessary to try to use people’s names for matching. As it turns out, people’s names can be messy, and are less suitable for use as unique identifiers than you might hope. I wrote a blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/compass-true-north/fuzzy-name-matching-dd7593754f19\">fuzzy name matching</a>, and you can look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/fuzzy-names\">source code</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/compass-true-north/fuzzy-name-matching-dd7593754f19\"><img src=\"portfolio/fuzzy/names-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/fuzzy-names\"><img src=\"portfolio/fuzzy/code-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"html-to-pdf\"></a>\n<h2>HTML to PDF Conversion</h2>\n<p>Marketing Center lets users design print-ready marketing materials such as flyers, brochures, postcards and notecards.

I wrote an <a href=\"fourfours/index.html\">interactive explorer</a> in React that helps candidates visualize the question. It’s an exercise in finding the simplicity in what seems like a complex problem, working forwards from what you do know instead of trying to work backwards from what you want to find out. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/tree/master/fourfours\">solutions</a> in several languages, including an elegant one-liner in <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/blob/master/fourfours/fourfours.clj#L12\">Clojure</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"fourfours/index.html\"><img src=\"portfolio/fourfours/fours.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/tree/master/fourfours\"><img src=\"portfolio/fourfours/code.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"subway\"></a>\n<h2>🧭 Subway Directions</h2>\n<p>This problem asks you to write a program to calculate the time that it would take to commute to the Compass office using the New York City Subway.

Given a list of recently featured articles and the artciles they link to, the task is to <a href=\"wikilinks/index.html\">construct an outline</a>. The challenge is that there are no root nodes, as you typically get into a loop of articles that link to each other.

I presented the platform at the National Retail Federation trade show in New York, giving demos to the engineering leadership of a hundred major retail companies.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral1.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral1-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral2.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral2-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral3.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral3-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral4.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/flare/trilateral4-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"twitter-tv\"></a>\n<h2>Twitter TV</h2>\n<p>I did a hacakthon project in which I replaced the entire SDP context and control architecture with one based on the Twitter platform. Your set-top box had its own account and would tweet what you were watching, along with the title card and a description of the episode. Then you could DM your STB with messages like “watch @topgear”, and it would find that show in the grid and change channels for you.

I tried making a highlight reel of the iPad 3 launch, which took hours of my time. What if we could do this automatically by measuring the volume of tweets on a particular hashtag like #ipad during an event? I wrote an algorithm to do exactly that, and made an auto-generated highlight reel. The money shot? When they announced the pricing. Turns out the reel based on hashtag buzz was pretty much the same as the manually curated one. Proved a point in about half a day of work.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad1.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad1-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad2.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/ipad/ipad2-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"privacy\"></a>\n<h2>Privacy</h2>\n<p>I gave a presentation on <a href=\"portfolio/privacy/privacy.pdf\">privacy</a> considerations in the context of building a personalized television platform.

My team and I worked with marketing to essentially distill the brain of a designer into an app called <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\">Marketing Center</a>, so agents could make high-quality materials using a self-service tool. It gave them enough flexibility to differentiate themselves while at the same time keeping everything on-brand.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/mc1.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/compass/screenshot.png\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/screenshot-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.compass.com/agents-compass/marketing/\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/mc2.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"window-displays\"></a>\n<h2>Window Displays</h2>\n<p>Marketing Center lets Compass agents create a variety of kinds of print marketing materials, including the listing cards that are displayed in office windows. I worked with the marketing team to create these layouts and implemented them as templates in Marketing Center. So when you walk by a Compass office and see listings in the window, I made that happen.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/compass/window.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/compass/window-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"lefeuil\"></a>\n<h2>Farm Brochure</h2>\n<p>When you’re developing software, you tend to run a program over and over in test mode. But the experience is totally different when you’re using it for real. One day I used Marketing Center to make a brochure for my own farmhouse in the south of France, and had it professionally printed. I put a lot of love into that brochure, which gave me an entirely new perspective on the software product that my team had created. </p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure1.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure1-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure2.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure2-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure3.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure3-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure4.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/brochure/brochure4-tn.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"marketing-automation\"></a>\n<h2>Marketing Automation</h2>\n<p>The Compass Marketing Center app made it easy for agents to make any kind of marketing materials, assuming they knew what they wanted to make. But it was still a challenge to remember what materials for what listings they needed to make when, and to decide which collateral types and templates would be most effective. I led the Marketing Automation team in building a system to coordinate an agent’s overall marketing strategy, using AI to give every agent the experience of having a dedicated marketing coach.</p>\n<a name=\"a3g\"></a>\n<h2>Agent at a Glance</h2>\n<p>As Compass scaled organically, agent information was spread across twenty different systems. The first team that I managed built a user adminstration tool called Agent at a Glance (A3G), which let our agent support team get the full picture without having to sign in to multiple systems. We took full advantage of a microservices-based architecture, with each service storing or retrieving a single type of data. </p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/a3g/a3g.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/a3g/a3g-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/a3g/dashboards.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/a3g/dash1.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"fuzzy-names\"></a>\n<h2>Fuzzy Name Matching</h2>\n<p>Identifying the same people in different databases can be a tricky problem. In an ideal world, people would all have a unique identifier that we could use to join records across databases. However, when this is not available, it may be necessary to try to use people’s names for matching. As it turns out, people’s names can be messy, and are less suitable for use as unique identifiers than you might hope. I wrote a blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/compass-true-north/fuzzy-name-matching-dd7593754f19\">fuzzy name matching</a>, and you can look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/fuzzy-names\">source code</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/compass-true-north/fuzzy-name-matching-dd7593754f19\"><img src=\"portfolio/fuzzy/names-tn.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/fuzzy-names\"><img src=\"portfolio/fuzzy/code-tn.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"html-to-pdf\"></a>\n<h2>HTML to PDF Conversion</h2>\n<p>Marketing Center lets users design print-ready marketing materials such as flyers, brochures, postcards and notecards.

I tried to make questiosn that were fun and interesting, and related to the real world in some meaningful way. I also wrote up solutions to the questions in thirteen different programming languages, to try to force myself to approach each problem from many different different perspectives.</p>\n<a name=\"fourfours\"></a>\n<h2>🔢 Four Fours</h2>\n<p>When I was young a friend presented me with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_fours\">four fours</a> problem: using just the number four exactly four times, can you write a mathematical expression that evaluates to every number from 1 to 100? I wrote an <a href=\"fourfours/index.html\">interactive explorer</a> in React that helps candidates visualize the question. It’s an exercise in finding the simplicity in what seems like a complex problem, working forwards from what you do know instead of trying to work backwards from what you want to find out. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/tree/master/fourfours\">solutions</a> in several languages, including an elegant one-liner in <a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/blob/master/fourfours/fourfours.clj#L12\">Clojure</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"fourfours/index.html\"><img src=\"portfolio/fourfours/fours.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/azamlerc/interviews/tree/master/fourfours\"><img src=\"portfolio/fourfours/code.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"subway\"></a>\n<h2>🧭 Subway Directions</h2>\n<p>This problem asks you to write a program to calculate the time that it would take to commute to the Compass office using the New York City Subway. You can walk to a station, take a train to another station, and from there walk to the office. As an extension, you can add the ability to transfer between trains. I made an <a href=\"subway.html\">interactive subway map</a> that helps people visualize the algorithm.

Given a list of recently featured articles and the artciles they link to, the task is to <a href=\"wikilinks/index.html\">construct an outline</a>. The challenge is that there are no root nodes, as you typically get into a loop of articles that link to each other.

For this project I made an <a href=\"countdown/index.html\">animated graph</a> of the New York Subway’s 7 Train, including a display of the train arrival countdown board.

One professor remarked, “we haven’t had this kind of spirit around here since the sixties.”</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"http://kavafoto.com/category.php?id=215370494-221690909&amp;photo=2010/04/12/jeremiah.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/kickthecan/jeremiah.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"http://kavafoto.com/category.php?id=514084999-762964394&amp;photo=2010/04/13/dsc_4208.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/kickthecan/kicking.jpg\"/></a>\n<a href=\"http://kavafoto.com/category.php?id=1771701915-222471455&amp;photo=2010/04/13/dsc_5230.jpg\"><img src=\"portfolio/kickthecan/concert.jpg\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"books\"></a>\n<h2>Photo Books</h2>\n<p>Here are some books that I made of my photo portfolio in 2005-2006.</p>\n<div class=\"carousel\">\n<a href=\"portfolio/books/photos1.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/books/photos1.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/books/photos2.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/books/photos2.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/books/red.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/books/red.png\"/></a>\n<a href=\"portfolio/books/newmexico.pdf\"><img src=\"portfolio/books/newmexico.png\"/></a>\n</div>\n<a name=\"natgeo\"></a>\n<h2>National Geographic</h2>\n<p>In 2001 we sent photo albums to all of our family members, each with a card in the format of a National Geographic cover that highlighted the selection of photos.
