People from diverse backgrounds come together to study the overlaps between these fields, and my concentration was in human computer interaction. One lasting effect was my approach to asking similar questions when comparing the diversity of <a href=\"allthethings.html\">computer languages</a> and <a href=\"song-titles.html\">human languages</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout my career, my most successful projects have been grounded in the type of systemic thinking that I learned in this program. I always try to ask questions like: What are we building? What is its reason for being? What is its nature? What are its principles? If you get these things right at the beginning of a project, it sets you up for success down the road.",

It's deliberately, almost stubbornly simple: load a video, show a banner on top, press OK to hand off seamlessly to the background player, press any key to come back. The Senza ShakaPlayer handles the sync between the browser player and the remote player automatically, and the auto-background feature makes the whole thing production-ready with a single configuration call. The pro version adds URL configuration for DRM, audio tracks, subtitles, and more. Keeping this app simple was a feature, not a limitation — and after watching Big Buck Bunny with a burned-in timecode approximately one million times, the seamless frame-accurate handoff between foreground and background never gets old.",

Arrow keys handle movement in all four directions, and the Back button drops into a command menu where you can navigate through every available verb and noun combination — the same Escape key that triggers command mode in Emacs. The implementation is a genuine example of how to make an existing web app fully navigable with a remote control, wrapped in the excuse of doing something completely absurd.

Compose an alert in the handy dashboard, pick a disaster icon (tsunami, wildfire, zombie apocalypse), select some groups to target, and broadcast it to all devices in those groups simultaneously. The TV app wakes up if it's in background mode and displays the alert. The demo keeps the disaster selection appropriately lighthearted given the times—but the infrastructure is real, and Senza customers will be well prepared for the next asteroid impact.",

Two streams play at once—one fullscreen, one tucked in the corner—and pressing a button swaps them with a smooth CSS animation. What makes it feel magical is the audio cross-fade: as one video shrinks, its volume fades out; as the other expands, it fades in. The result feels less like a UI transition and more like a mixing board. Demonstrates that Senza's cloud browser is genuinely powerful enough to handle multi-video experiences that would be unthinkable on a traditional set-top box.",

Each time you guess a word, you enter in the response that indicates which letters are in the right place, wrong place or not in the word. It will then provide a list of the best words for you to play next. From my point of view, I'm not cheating: I just took my own strategy and taught the computer to do it for me.",

I wrote a program in Objective-C to process the text of the book, break apart compound and conjugated words, translate them to English, and create a dictionary of Dutch as used in the book. The dictionary is in the form of a tag cloud, with more frequently used words in larger text, and words with common prefixes grouped together.",

My phone kept going to sleep and I had paint all over my hands, so I wound up kind of painting it from memory rather than looking at the original while I was working. It turned out a bit abstract, but not bad considering that I was in a rush to finish in 45 minutes. I had the original photo printed on canvas so the two could be displayed side by side.",
